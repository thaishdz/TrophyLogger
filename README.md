# 🏆 TrophyLogger (v0)

## Setting Up the API

### Step 1: Running Services with Docker Compose

To start the services, run the following command:
```sh
docker compose up 
```
This will build the images automatically if they are not already available on your machine.

If you prefer to run the containers in the background, use detached mode by adding the -d flag:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```
